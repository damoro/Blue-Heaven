      <p>
        The effects of psychedelic drugs like LSD are difficult to categorize – they affect different people, at different places, and at different times, with incredible variability.
        However, LSD and other psychedelics are known for their profound changes in consciousness and perception. LSD’s effects last around 8-10 hours, with peak effects occurring 4-6 hours after ingestion.

    <label for="section2" class="accordion__label">What is the cultural history of LSD?</label>
    <div class="accordion__content">
      <p>
        The epicenter of the culture around LSD use, San Francisco, was the home of what became known as the “Summer of Love” in 1967. In the popular press and among politicians, LSD became associated with this youth-led social movement steeped in antiwar demonstrations, sexual experimentation, and cultural upheaval, which largely ignored some of the potential downfalls of widespread use in uncontrolled settings.
        LSD’s widespread popularity at the time meant that it was often used in chaotic settings and sometimes by people who did not know what they were taking or who were otherwise unprepared for the experience. Media began reporting on strange behavior and negative outcomes associated with LSD use.
        In 1968 President Nixon declared drugs to be “public enemy number one” and in 1970 signed the Controlled Substances Act, placing LSD in Schedule I. Nixon’s domestic policy chief admitted decades later that their declaration of a war on drugs was a tool to vilify the anti-war left, Black people, and other minorities.

    <label for="section3" class="accordion__label">Is LSD addictive?</label>
    <div class="accordion__content">
      <p>
        LSD is not considered to be addictive nor does it cause compulsive use. One reason is that the intense, long-lasting experience, which can be physically and mentally challenging, may cause people using LSD non-medically to limit their frequency of use.
        Another reason is that the human body quickly builds tolerance to LSD, such that users require much higher doses after only a few days of repeated use, making it extremely difficult to have any effect after more than four days of repeated usage.

    <label for="section4" class="accordion__label">How risky is LSD compared to other drugs?</label>
    <div class="accordion__content">
      <p>
        LSD is considered one of the least toxic drugs used non-medically. Recent results from epidemiological studies have shown lower rates of mental health disorders and suicide among people who have used psychedelics like LSD.
        However, there have been cases of adverse psychological reactions to LSD leading to both successful and unsuccessful suicide attempts. Beginning in the 1960’s and continuing today, sensationalized media coverage of LSD-related deaths inaccurately portray adverse reactions as increasing suicidal behavior or accidental death due to loss of control. Many of the stories reported misattributed the role of LSD in the situation, or in some cases didn’t involve LSD at all

    <div class="accordion__content">
      <p>
        Yes,  LSD is illegal. LSD is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act. Schedule I drugs, which include heroin and MDMA, have a high potential for abuse and serve no legitimate medical purpose.

    <label for="section6" class="accordion__label">Can LSD cause long-term problems?</label>
    <div class="accordion__content">
      <p>
        It is possible to experience flashbacks weeks, months or years after taking LSD. Flashbacks are when you feel the effects of the drug again, like having hallucinations, for a minute or 2. They are more common in people who use LSD regularly.
        Using LSD can damage the memory and concentration. LSD may also trigger or worsen mental health problems like depression, anxiety and schizophrenia.

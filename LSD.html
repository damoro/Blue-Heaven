          <p>Lysergide (LSD) is a semi-synthetic hallucinogen, and is one of the most potent drugs known. Recreational use became popular between the 1960s to 1980s, but is now less common. It can block the action of the neurotransmitter serotonin and produces marked deviations from normal perceptions and behaviour lasting 8–10 hours or longer. Mood shifts, time and space distortions, and impulsive behaviour may progress to paranoia and aggression. Flashbacks to LSD-induced hallucinations can occur years later. LSD is not an approved drug, and no clinically valuable uses have been found for it. It is generally believed that most LSD is produced outside Europe, but secondary preparation of dosage units by dipping or spotting paper squares is more widespread. These dosage units usually bear coloured designs featuring cartoon characters, geometric and abstract motifs. LSD is related to other substituted tryptamines, and is under international control.</p>

            <p>LSD is normally produced as tartrate salt, which is colourless, odourless and water soluble. The common street dose forms are ‘blotters’ or <a href="Site/lsd_collage.jpg" target="_blank">‘paper squares’</a> — sheets of absorbent paper printed with distinctive designs and perforated so they may be torn into single small (typically 7 mm) squares each containing a single dose. Each sheet typically contains 100 or more doses. LSD is less commonly seen as small tablets (‘microdots’) that are 2–3 mm in diameter, as thin gelatine squares (‘window panes’) or in capsules. Solutions of LSD in water or alcohol are occasionally encountered. LSD is light sensitive in solution, but more stable in dosage units.</p>

              <p>LSD was first synthesised by Albert Hoffman while working for Sandoz Laboratories in Basel in 1938. Some years later, during a re-evaluation of the compound, he accidentally ingested a small amount and described the first ‘trip’. During the 1950s and 1960s, Sandoz evaluated the drug for therapeutic purposes and marketed it under the name Delysid®. It was used for research into the chemical origins of mental illness. Recreational use started in the 1960s and is associated with the ‘psychedelic period’.</p>

            <br>
              <p>Psychedelic drugs can affect the function and structure of the brain and promote neuron growth.Exactly how LSD affects the brain is complicated, but it seems to interact with multiple receptors and chemicals, such as serotonin and dopamine.Research is exploring the use of LSD in developing new ways of thinking and ‘resetting’ the brain’s habitual patterns of thought.The renewed interest in LSD is building on studies conducted 40 years ago primarily focusing on treating: depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, drug dependency, reducing anxiety in patients with a life-threatening disease.</p><p>The role of LSD in improving mental health is linked to a weakening or ‘dissolution’ of the ego, helping individuals see the ‘bigger picture’ beyond their personal problems. For therapeutic treatment, LSD is administered under supervision in a safe environment, such as a psychologist’s office. The psychologist or medical professional provides guidance and reassurance as the patient experiences the effects of the drug. Although the patient’s consciousness is dramatically altered, they still have a clear memory of their experience. While LSD doesn’t seem to pose a risk for dependency, and no overdose deaths have been reported, some people do experience anxiety and confusion. There have also been rare cases of self-harm outside of a therapeutic context. People can have powerfully confronting experiences under the influence of LSD which is why administering it in a controlled environment where the participant is informed, supported and monitored, is important.</p>
